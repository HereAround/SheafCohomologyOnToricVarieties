README file for the `cohomCalgInterface' GAP4 package


(1) Installation
--------------------------

To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 

This package requires a working installation of cohomCalg on your computer. You can download the latest version from https://github.com/BenjaminJurke/cohomCalg. Alternatively, you can find a version at https://github.com/HereAround/cohomCalg in the branch martindevel, which reduces the amount of output to the terminal, and therefore leads to a more integrated experience in gap.

Once cohomCalg is sucessfully installed, you need to place the binary file into the binary folder of this package. This completes the installation of this package.


(2) Documentation and test
--------------------------

You can create the documentation for this package by issuing

gap makedoc

inside the SpasmInterface folder. This requires to have a running LaTeX installation. In this case, the documentation will subsequently be available inside the /doc subfolder as manual.pdf.

After this step, you can also issue a test on this software by issuing

gap maketest.g
