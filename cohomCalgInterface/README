README file for the `cohomCalgInterface' GAP4 package
        
To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 

This package requires a working installation of cohomCalg on your computer. You can download the latest version from https://github.com/BenjaminJurke/cohomCalg. Alternatively, you can find a version at 
https://github.com/HereAround/cohomCalg in the branch martindevel, which reduces the amount of output to the terminal, and therefore leads to a more integrated experience in gap.

Once cohomCalg is sucessfully installed, you need to place the binary file into the binary folder of this package. This completes the installation of this package.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I would like to hear about applications of this package.
