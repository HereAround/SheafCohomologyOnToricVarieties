@Chapter Introduction

@Section What is the goal of the H0Approximator package?

**H0Approximator** provides functionality to estimate global sections from topological counts only. A refined approximation checks irreducibility of curves, and thereby computes more accurate results, at the expense of longer runtimes.

The current implementations is specific to hypersurface curves in dP3 and pullback line bundles thereon. Generalizations thereof are reserved for future work.
