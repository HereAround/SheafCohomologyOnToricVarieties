  [33X[0;0Y[13XSheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties[113X  provides  data  structures to compute sheaf
  cohomology   on   such   varieties.   The   ultimate   goal  is  to  provide
  high-performance-algorithms  for  its computation. To this, our main theorem
  for  the  computation  of sheaf cohomology is based on an idea of Gregory G.
  Smith (see math/0305214 and DOI: 10.4171/OWR/2013/25), which we combine with
  the  powerful cohomCalg algorithm. Information on the latter can be found at
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.5217v3 and references therein.[133X
