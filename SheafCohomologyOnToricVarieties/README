README file for the `SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties' GAP4 package
        
To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch
from github. 

To complete the installation you need a working version of cohomCalg. A version prepared for the use with this package, can be obtained from the development branch 'martindevel' of my repository https://github.com/HereAround/cohomCalg/. 

Once you download/clone this repository, just switch into the folder 'cohomCalg' and type make. Now you should find a binary file in /cohomCalg/bin. This binary file needs to be moved to the SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties package folder. This package contains a subfolder /cohomCalg, which in turn currently contains two subfolders. The latter two are named 'linux' and 'apple', respectively. Place the binary in the folder which fits your system.

Note that the folder name, has to match the exact architecture string used by gap. You can find this string by startgin gap and entering "GAPInfo.Architecture". If a folder with this name does not yet exist in the /cohomCalg subfolder, then please create it and subsequently place the binary in this folder. This completes the installation of the package.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
