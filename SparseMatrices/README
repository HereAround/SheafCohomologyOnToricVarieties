README file for the `SparseMatrices' GAP4 package

To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 


(1) Installation this package
-----------------------------

This package requires a working installation of the software `Smasto' on your computer. Currently, only part of the functionality of Smasto is supported by this interface.

The latest version of Smasto can be found at https://github.com/riccardomurri/smasto. To install this software, clone this git-repository by issuing

git clone https://github.com/riccardomurri/smasto

Then cd into the smasto folder and configure the package. On Ubuntu 18.04, first issue the following commands

aclocal
autoconf
autoreconf --install

This will have created a configure file for you. Unfortunately, as of this writing the used boost version is too old. To modify it, first issue

apt-cache show libboost-dev

to find out what version of boost you are running. This could for example be version 1.65.1.1. Then open the configure file and search for the line

boost_cv_lib_version=`cat conftest.i`

Modify it to match your version of boost. E.g. for version 1.65.1.1 write

boost_cv_lib_version="1_65_1_1".

You can now configure smasto by issusing ./configure --prefix=*some/path*. Suppose your version of smasto is located at /home/user/smasto. Then I recommend to use

./configure --prefix=/home/user/smasto/build

This will configure smasto such that, inside the smasto folder, the installation files will be located in the subfolder /build. Since you have write priviliges to this folder, no root rights are required for the following installation. Thus simply issue

make
make install

both without sudo.

Finally, we need to configure the SparseMatrices package such that it can actually find your smasto installation. Let us assume that smasto is located at /home/user/smasto. Then do the following:

(1) Start gap
(2) Load SparseMatrices by issuing "LoadPackage( "SparseMatrices" );"
(3) Issue "SetSmastoDirectory( "/home/user/smasto" );"

This completes the installation of this package. More details/information on how to install smasto can be found at https://github.com/riccardomurri/smasto.


(2) Documentation and test
--------------------------

You can create the documentation for this package by issuing

gap makedoc.g

inside the SparseMatrices folder. Provided a running LaTeX installation, the documentation will subsequently be available inside the /doc subfolder as manual.pdf.

After this step, you can also issue a test on this software by issuing

gap maketest.g


(3) Contact
--------------------------

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I would like to hear about applications of this package.
