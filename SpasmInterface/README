README file for the `SpasmInterface' GAP4 package
        
To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 

This package requires a working installation of the software `Spasm' on your computer. The latest version is available by download from https://github.com/cbouilla/spasm.

The installation of this software typically requires the following steps inside the Spasm folder:

./configure
make
make install

However, the ./configure file is currently (20/01/2020) not included in the above-mentioned git repository. To create it, on Ubuntu 18.04 the following command had to be issued inside the Spasm folder:

aclocal
autoconf
autoreconf --install

More details/information can be found in the Spasm package. This completes the installation of this gap-package. It should be mentioned that currently, only part of the functionality in Spasm is supported by this interface.

E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, I would like to hear about applications of this package.
