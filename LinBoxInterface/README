README file for the `LinBoxInterface' GAP4 package

To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 


(1) Installation this package
-----------------------------

This package requires a working installation of the software `LinBox' on your computer. Currently, only part of the functionality of LinBox is supported by this interface.

The latest version of LinBox can be downloaded from https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox.

In order to communicate with LinBox, we need to configure this interface with the directory of your LinBox installation. Let us assume that it is located at /home/usr/linbox. Then do the following:

(1) Start gap
(2) Load LinBoxInterface by issuing "LoadPackage( "LinBoxInterface" );"
(3) Issue "SetLinboxDirectory( "/home/usr/linbox/MyCode" );"

Note that we have added the subfolder /MyCode to the location of LinBox. This subfolder contains the binaries which this interface triggers. This completes this customized installation.

More details/information on how to install LinBox can be found at https://linalg.org/.


(2) Documentation and test
--------------------------

You can create the documentation for this package by issuing

gap makedoc

inside the LinBoxInterface folder. This requires to have a running LaTeX installation. In this case, the documentation will subsequently be available inside the /doc subfolder as manual.pdf.

After this step, you can also issue a test on this software by issuing

gap maketest.g
