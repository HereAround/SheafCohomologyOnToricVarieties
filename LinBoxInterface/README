README file for the `LinBoxInterface' GAP4 package

To get the latest version of this GAP 4 package pull the corresponding branch from github. 


(1) Installation this package
-----------------------------

The latest version of LinBox can be downloaded from https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox. Currently, only part of the functionality of LinBox is supported by this interface. For convenience, we provide the corresponding binaries in the /bin subfolder of this pakage.

Note that the kernel computations with Linbox are as of this writing (06/02/2020) unstable (c.f. https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/issues/245).

More details/information on LinBox can be found at https://linalg.org/.


(2) Documentation and test
--------------------------

You can create the documentation for this package by issuing

gap makedoc

inside the LinBoxInterface folder. This requires to have a running LaTeX installation. In this case, the documentation will subsequently be available inside the /doc subfolder as manual.pdf.

After this step, you can also issue a test on this software by issuing

gap maketest.g
